      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, my name is Nhan Nguyen, however, I also go by Kevin. I’m an
        international student from Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. I’m doing
        co-terminal degree with ITM and CyberSecurity. Last semester, I
        have an internship at Supply Clinic as a Data Analyst. For spring
        2020, I just receive an offer to work as an investigator at CFTC.
      </p>

      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>
        I used to play Basketball and Football in JV team at High School.
        Beside school, I usually go to play soccer with friends on the
        weekend. During the week, I like going to the gym. Moreover, music
        has played an important role in my life. It's help me go through
        depression.
      </p>

      <h2>Career</h2>
      <p>
        I’m very excited to graduate in May 2020. My goal is becoming a
        CIO of a company. To achieve my goal, I will need to experience in
        IT security and get IT certificates.
