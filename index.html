    <h1>NHAN NGUYEN <b> Background and Ambitions</h1>
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, my name is Nhan Nguyen, however, I also go by Kevin.
        I’m an international student from Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam.
      </p>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        I’m doing co-terminal degree with ITM and CyberSecurity. Last semester, I have
        an internship at Supply Clinic as a Data Analyst. For spring 2020, I just
        receive an offer to work as an investigator at CFTC.
      </p>
      <h2>Ambitions</h2>
      <p>
        I have taken a few web development at IIT. I'm taking this class because
        it's very cool to study Hummanity but learning on HTML/CSS instead of
        writing essay.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m very excited to graduate in May 2020. My goal is becoming a CIO of a
        company. To achieve my goal, I will need to experience in IT security and get IT
        certificates.
