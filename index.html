              Hi, my name is Nhan Nguyen, however, I also go by Kevin.
              I’m an international student from Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. I’m doing co-terminal degree with ITM and CyberSecurity. Last semester, I have an internship at Supply Clinic as a Data Analyst. For spring 2020, I just receive an offer to work as an investigator at CFTC.

              I used to play Basketball and Football in JV team at High School. Beside school, I usually go to play soccer with friends on the weekend. During the week, I like going to the gym. Moreover, music has played an important role in my life. It's help me go through depression.
