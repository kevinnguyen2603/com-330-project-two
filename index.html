        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, my name is Nhan Nguyen, however, I also go by Kevin.
          I’m an international student from Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam.

      <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          I’m doing co-terminal degree with ITM and CyberSecurity. Last semester, I have
          an internship at Supply Clinic as a Data Analyst. For spring 2020, I just
          receive an offer to work as an investigator at CFTC.
        </p>

      <h2>Ambitions</h2>
        <p>
          I have taken a few web development at IIT. I'm taking this class because
          it's very cool to study Hummanity but learning on HTML/CSS instead of
          writing essay.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m very excited to graduate in May 2020. My goal is becoming a CIO of a
          company. To achieve my goal, I will need to experience in IT security and get IT
          certificates.
